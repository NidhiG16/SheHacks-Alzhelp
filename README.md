Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. As the disease progresses, patients experience memory loss, confusion, and difficulties with daily activities. Managing Alzheimer's disease is a complex task that requires careful monitoring and intervention from medical professionals. 
However, doctors often face challenges in effectively managing Alzheimer's patients due to the lack of a comprehensive tool that can assist in tracking the patient's progress and provide personalized care. 
Therefore, there is a need for an Alzheimer management app that can help doctors in monitoring and managing their Alzheimer's patients. The app should provide features that enable doctors to track the patient's cognitive decline, medication schedules, and behavioral changes. It should also provide personalized recommendations based on the patient's medical history and other relevant factors. 
The app should be user-friendly, accessible, and secure, ensuring that patient data is kept confidential. The app should also be regularly updated with the latest research and best practices for Alzheimer's management, providing doctors with the most up-to-date information to deliver optimal care.
